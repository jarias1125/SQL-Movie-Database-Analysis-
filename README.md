# Movies Database Analysis - SQL Project

## Overview
This project is part of the MSc in DSAIS (2024-2025) group exercise, focusing on analyzing and handling data imperfections in a **movies database**. The primary goal is to evaluate and clean data, ensuring accurate insights. The project emphasizes best practices in SQL query structuring, handling missing values, and deriving key movie-related analytics.

## Brief Description
This SQL project focuses on evaluating and cleaning a **movies database**, addressing data imperfections, and extracting insights through structured queries. The main tasks involve handling missing values, ensuring data integrity, analyzing trends such as film duration over time, and optimizing query performance. The repository contains well-documented SQL scripts designed to enhance data accuracy and facilitate meaningful analysis.

## SQL Objectives
- Evaluate data imperfections, particularly dealing with NULL and N/A values.
- Ensure data integrity for accurate movie analysis.
- Query and analyze metadata for better understanding of movie trends.
- Implement best SQL practices, including proper documentation and structured queries.

## Key Tasks Addressed
1. **Handling Missing Data** - Identifying and resolving NULL or N/A values in key fields such as movie duration.
2. **Data Integrity Checks** - Ensuring accurate relationships and valid data across tables.
3. **Descriptive Analytics** - Querying key statistics such as average film duration over time.
4. **Database Optimization** - Enhancing SQL queries for performance and efficiency.

## Implementation Approach
- **Data Cleaning:** Structured SQL queries to identify and replace missing or inconsistent values.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Querying trends in movie duration and other metadata attributes.
- **Query Optimization:** Ensuring efficient execution of analytical queries.
- **Best Practices:** Properly commenting on SQL queries to ensure readability and maintainability.

## Key Outcomes
- Cleaned and structured data for effective movie analysis.
- Insights into trends, including the evolution of film duration over the years.
- Optimized SQL queries to facilitate efficient data retrieval and processing.
- Well-documented SQL scripts for reproducibility and clarity.

## Repository Contents
- **SQL_Project.sql**: Main SQL script containing all queries for data evaluation and insights.
- **Documentation**: Includes detailed explanations of the queries and results.

## How to Use
1. Load the provided **movies database** into a SQL environment.
2. Run the **SQL_Project.sql** script to analyze and clean the dataset.
